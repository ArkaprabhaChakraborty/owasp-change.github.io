# OWASP needs to evolve

To the OWASP Board of Directors and the Executive Director of the OWASP Foundation,

OWASP was first set up over two decades ago. The Internet, the way we build software, and the security industry, has changed so much that those days are hardly recognizable today.

As a group of OWASP flagship project leaders and lifelong contributors, we believe that OWASP hasn't kept pace and evolved to support the needs of important parts of our community today, especially our flagship projects. What worked in the past simply isnâ€™t working now and OWASP needs to change.
